<h2>Get Fancy</h2>

<p>So you&rsquo;ve created a coffee website. Now it&rsquo;s time to make sure it&rsquo;s responsive. You&rsquo;ll also need to add some CSS transitions to create a clearer sense of UX.</p>

<h2>Responsive requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create at least 2 breakpoints.</li>
<li>The first breakpoint should be at 768px, a standard screen size. The four columns should go down to two columns.</li>
<li>The next breakpoint should be at 480px, a good benchmark for mobile devices. The four columns should go down to a single column, and the paragraphs at the top should also be a single column.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Transitions to include</h2>

<p>Create different transitions to spice things up. Include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>One coffee item should fade in a background color when hovered over</li>
<li>One coffee item should grow to 1.5 its current size when hovered over</li>
<li>One coffee item&rsquo;s text should grow by 150% when hovered over</li>
<li>One coffee item should become completely transparent when hovered over</li>
</ul>
