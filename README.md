## Get Fancy

So you've created a coffee website. Now it's time to make sure it's responsive. You'll also need to add some CSS transitions to create a clearer sense of UX.

## Responsive requirements

* Make the coffee bag images resize as the window resizes

### Below 480px

* Start with a base font size (in your `html` tag) that works best on mobile).
* Nav items should stack vertically.
* Show the coffee bean background image behind the title, not bheind the paragraphs below it.
* One column of header text.
* Don't use any columns for the coffee bags.
* Coffee bags and text should appear side-by-side.

### Above 480px

* Make the base font size bigger, for desktop use.
* Horizontal nav.
* Make nav fixed.
* Header paragraphs to two columns.
* Put the coffee bags in two columns.

### Above 768px

* Don't let the page go wider than 800 or 900px, whatever you feel works.
* Put the coffee bags into four columns.
* Descriptive text should appear underneath the coffee bags.

## Transitions

Create different transitions to spice things up. Include the following:

* One coffee item should fade in a background color when hovered over
* One coffee item should grow to 1.5x its current size when hovered over
* One coffee item's text should grow by 150% when hovered over
* One coffee item should become completely transparent when hovered over
