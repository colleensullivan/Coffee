## Get Fancy

So you've created a coffee website. Now it's time to make sure it's responsive. You'll also need to add some CSS transitions to create a clearer sense of UX.

## Responsive requirements

* Create at least 2 breakpoints.
* The first breakpoint should be at 768px, a standard screen size. The four columns should go down to two columns.
* The next breakpoint should be at 480px, a good benchmark for mobile devices. The four columns should go down to a single column, and the paragraphs at the top should also be a single column. 

## Transitions to include

Create different transitions to spice things up. Include the following:

* One coffee item should fade in a background color when hovered over
* One coffee item should grow to 1.5 its current size when hovered over
* One coffee item's text should grow by 150% when hovered over
* One coffee item should become completely transparent when hovered over
