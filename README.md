## Get Fancy

So you've created a coffee website. Now it's time to make sure it's responsive. You'll also need to add some CSS transitions to create a clearer sense of UX.

## Responsive requirements

* Make the coffee bag images resize as the window resizes

### Below 480px

* Lower the base font size so that there's more content on the screen at once.
* Only show the coffee bean background behind the title, not the text below it.
* One column of header text.
* Don't use any columns for the coffee types.
* Nav shouldn't be fixed, nav items should stack vertically

### Above 480px
* Header paragraphs to two columns.
* Put the coffee types in two columns.
* Make the base font size bigger

### Above 768px

* Put the coffee types into four columns.
* Don't let the page go wider than 800 or 900px, whatever you feel works.

## Transitions

Create different transitions to spice things up. Include the following:

* One coffee item should fade in a background color when hovered over
* One coffee item should grow to 1.5 its current size when hovered over
* One coffee item's text should grow by 150% when hovered over
* One coffee item should become completely transparent when hovered over
