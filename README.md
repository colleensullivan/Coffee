## Get Fancy

So you've created a coffee website. Now it's time to make sure it's responsive. You'll also need to add some CSS transitions to create a clearer sense of UX.

## Responsive requirements

* Make the coffee bag images resize as the window resizes

### Below 480px

* Only show the coffee bean background behind the title, not the text below it.
* One column of header text.
* Don't use any columns for the coffee types.

### Above 480px

* Header paragraphs to two columns.
* Put the coffee types in two columns.

### Above 768px

* Put the coffee types into four columns.

## Transitions

Create different transitions to spice things up. Include the following:

* One coffee item should fade in a background color when hovered over
* One coffee item should grow to 1.5 its current size when hovered over
* One coffee item's text should grow by 150% when hovered over
* One coffee item should become completely transparent when hovered over
